Think cap is a piece of hardware made using the Arduino prototyping platform. It is designed to be integrated in a regular hat or ball cap and be practical undetectable.The device ramps up to a steady current of 2mA and passes this voltage from the anodal side to the cathodal side exciting the anodally stimulated area and depressing the cathode area. This project was entirely designed and coded by Ian Linnel base of experiments performed by Grindhouse Wetware.
