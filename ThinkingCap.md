# Introduction #

Thinking cap is a grinder designed tDCs device made by Grind House Wetwares.
tDCs stands for [Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcranial_direct-current_stimulation). Thinking cap stimulates the  [dorsolateral prefrontal cortex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorsolateral_prefrontal_cortex) with a safe amount of DC current. By doing so thinking cap is stimulating the the parts of the mind that deal with working memory and concentration.


# Details #

The thinking cap tDCs device consisting of four major parts, these parts are: hat, electrodes, processing unit, and power unit.

## Processing unit ##

The processing unit of thinking cap for the time being is the [ATMega328P](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9061?) micro-processor.

## Power Unit ##

For the time being the thinking cap is powered by two nine volt batteries. The batteries are replaceable and at this time thinking cap does not have recharging capabilities, but Grind House Wetwares is working toward a more efficient solution.

## Electrodes ##

The electrodes are the part opf thinking cap that are applied the the users head. There are two electrodes on thinking cap; the anode and the cathode. The anode and cathode are marked by the color the wire connecting the electrode to the processing unit. The anode red, the cathode black (or green), depending on generation of thinking cap. The anode is placed on the left side of the users head. The cathode is placed on right side of users head.
